   ** Clean up boot logging functions
   ** Fix interactive prompt between run level S and target run level

2011-10-06  Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>

   * Add configuration for udev_retry, and remove --type=failed (which does
     not work with recent udev versions anyway, since no events can possibly
     trigger it).  Start with just the "rtc" subsystem.  BLFS should eventually
     add "sound" to this file, and perhaps others.

2011-09-18
   * Review and update of changes made in previous change.
   ** Rename /etc/sysconfig/init_params to /etc/sysconfig/rc.site.

   *** /lib/lsb is a symlink to /lib/services.
   * Create convenience symlink /etc/init.d->/etc/rc.d/init.d.
   * Add help and man pages to upup/ifdown.
   * Append /run/var/bootlog to /var/log/boot.log at the end of 
     the boot sequence.
   * Add capabiltiy to step through the boot scripts at boot time

   ** Add /etc/sysconfig/init_params for adding environmental parameters
      to all functions used in bootscripts
   ** Move network configuration to /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.*.  The 
      ifconfig files can have any extension.  Use IFACE parameter to 
      specify the target network interface within the configuration file.
   ** Adds an optional parameter, SKIPTMPCLEAN, to skip the removal of 
      files in /tmp at bootup.  Specify the variable in 
      /etc/sysconfig/init_params.

2011-05-31  DJ Lucas <dj@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev: Add multiple udev triggers for both subsystems and
     devices per upstream recommendation.

2011-04-19  Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/mountvirtfs: Add creation of /run/{var,lock,shm}.
   * lfs/init.d/udev: Add /dev/shm -> /run/shm symlink.

2011-04-18  Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/mountvirtfs: Change name from mountkernfs to mountvirtfs.
     Add mounting of /run filesystem.

2010-05-29  Matt Burgess <matthew@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev: Only copy /lib/udev/devices/null, as Udev >= 155 copies
     devices from /lib/udev/devices to /dev itself.  Udevd still needs /dev/null
     present before starting up though.

2010-04-20  Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev, lfs/init.d/udev_retry: Add --action=add, to handle udev
   version 152 and newer, which send "change" events by default in udevtrigger
   now.

2010-01-24  Matthew Burgess <matthew@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev: Check to see if /dev is already mounted, as it may be if
     under an initramfs environment.  See ticket #2550.

2009-08-14  Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev_retry: Use "udevadm trigger --type=failed", which
     apparently replaced "--retry-failed" some time ago.  "--retry-failed" is
     removed in udev-146.

2009-01-02  Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions:
   * lfs/sysconfig/network-devices/ifup: 
     Updated line widths to accommodate pdf generation in both the above 
     files.

2008-10-27  DJ Lucas <dj@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/cleanfs: Removed '! -newer /proc' from find commands in
     check for stale files in /var/lock and /var/run.
   * Makefile: Reversed cleanfs and udev_retry scripts so that cleanfs
     runs immediately after mountfs.

2008-10-26  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: Remove stale pid files when encountered
     in loadproc/killproc/reloadproc. When the bootscript specifies
     a pid file to use with the "-p pidfile" argument, *proc
     functions previously bailed out when the referenced file
     contains an invalid pid.

2008-10-23  DJ Lucas <dj@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/console: Removed BROKEN_COMPOSE as kernel patch has
     been accepted upstream.

2008-05-21  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev, lfs/init.d/udev_retry: Use new udevadm program.

2007-08-20  DJ Lucas <dj@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/setclock: Added missing 'stop' argument to usage text

2007-08-13  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/checkfs: Don't suppress error messages from the screen.

2007-07-18  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * Makefile, lfs/init.d/consolelog: New bootscript controlling the
     kernel log level on the console. This is controlled by the LOGLEVEL
     variable in /etc/sysconfig/console.
   * lfs/init.d/modules: Remove the log level handling since this is
     done in the consolelog script now.
   * lfs/init.d/modules: Clean up the script by removing the file
     descriptor duplication and instead just redirecting
     /etc/sysconfig/modules to the input of the while loop.

2007-06-16  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/mountfs, lfs/init.d/mountkernfs, lfs/init.d/setclock,
     lfs/init.d/modules, lfs/sysconfig/network-devices/if{up,down}:
     Don't suppress stderr during bootscripts unless necessary. This
     would prevent potentially critical messages from reaching the screen.

2007-04-24  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: When killproc is executed, it checks that
     the process is still running, sleeps if it is, then checks again.
     The sleep is 1 second in between checks. By sleeping for 0.1 seconds
     in between checks, killproc is much faster as it's wasting much
     less time sleeping in the normal case that the process has died
     after a short delay.

2007-04-16  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: Redirect stderr when using kill to suppress
     output.
   * lfs/init.d/functions: killproc() was not handling the case where a
     pidfile is passed to the function. The logic with the signal to be
     used was causing issues with the handling of pidfiles. This has been
     fixes, and now killproc() will recheck the process if the signal
     was TERM (the default) or KILL.
   * lfs/init.d/functions: statusproc() has been changed to use pidofproc()
     instead of the deprecated getpids(). Additionally, it now accepts
     the -p argument to specify a pidfile.
   * lfs/init.d/functions: Currently, statusproc() always returns
     successfully, and the only way to know if the process is running
     is to parse the output. This changes statusproc() to return the
     status of pidofproc(), which will return unsuccessfully if the
     requested process is not running.
   * lfs/init.d/functions: Changed reloadproc() to use pidofproc() and
     respect the -p argument for pidfiles.
   * lfs/init.d/sysklogd: Remove a useless argument to reloadproc().

2007-03-13  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: If pidofproc() is passed the -p argument
     it can bomb testing a null variable with an integer expression.

2007-02-22  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/mountfs, lfs/init.d/console, lfs/init.d/setclock,
     lfs/init.d/mountkernfs: &> redirection is not supported in POSIX.
     Fortunately, it's equivalent to >word 2>&1 according to bash(1).

2007-02-22  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/console: POSIX says that shells only need to trap on
     signals. Trapping on ERR isn't always supported. Conditionals have
     been added to set the $failed variable in spots that seemed
     appropriate for checking errors.

2007-02-22  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: Use arithmetic expansion and string length,
     which are both mandated by POSIX, rather than spawning two processes
     every time boot_mesg() is called.

2007-02-22  Dan Nicholson  <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/functions: In order to provide an `echo' which provides
     handles the -e and -n options for all POSIX shells, a feature test
     is added which stores its result in $ECHO. /bin/echo will be used
     if the default echo is not capable. Changed the existing functions
     to reference $ECHO when needed.
   * lfs/init.d/console: Use $ECHO when -en is needed.

2007-02-03  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * ChangeLog: Rename from CHANGELOG, start using GNU style entries.

   * Makefile: Move setclock before checkfs.  Fixes #1948.

2006-11-25  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * lfs/init.d/udev_retry: Copy Debian's "copy generated rules" initscript
     code, to clean up when the rule_generator scripts run before / is
     writable.  (Since the rule_generator code is from Debian, I assume their
     cleanup code is appropriate.)

2006-10-15  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>

   * Edited mountkernfs, so that if you can mount sysfs on /sys, it will
     be mounted at boottime.  Should not affect 2.4 systems
   * Since all entries are added to /etc/mtab, we should not require
     the NO_FS variable.  It has been removed from mountfs
   * Added the udev script into the contrib directory, submitted by Zack

2.0.3 - April 8, 2004

   * Updated cleanfs, so it can create devices.  Supplied by Zack
   * Tagged as 2.0.3

n/a - March 31, 2004

   * Fixed the rc5.d symlink for ntp so it creates S26ntp instead
     of S26npt

     fix the problems
   * Also changed all instances of <ctrl-j> back to enter

1.99.3 - February 23, 2004

   * Tagged as development release 1.99.3

n/a - February 19, 2004

   * Fixed checkfs script, so it will no longer continue to boot after a
     failure in the init.d/checkfs script.  Tested with the help of Andre
     Müller.  Fix suggested by Zack

n/a - February 7, 2004

   * Added -s onto grep on network stop
   * Replaced a few more enter's with ctrl-j

1.99.2 - February 6, 2004

   * Added -s onto grep in network start

     functions
   * Changed above fixes to work with ash
   * Fixed checkfs symlink in Makefile
   * functions is no longer installed as executable

     linux system

1.99.1 - February 2, 2004

   * Tagged as development release 1.99.1

n/a - February 2, 2004:

   * Added -d to umount in mountfs.
   * Fixed network shutdown script
   * Fixed Makefile rc.6 to reboot
   * Added -s flag to grep command in rc.d/init.d/network -
     suppresses an error if no ifconfig.* files exist

n/a - January 30, 2004:

   * Reorganized the network system to accept multiple services.
   * Ash Compliancy
   * Modified some scripts to follow template
   * Reorganized functions, based upon Ash Compliancy Patch
   * Added a sleep 5 to failure for evaulate_retval, and changed
     evaulate_retval to return true instead of false.  Instead, a
     exit 1 will indicate the script terminated abnormally, causing
     your system to wait until you hit ctrl-J
   * Switched "Press enter to continue" to "Press <ctrl-j> to continue"
   * replaced 3 with $KILLDELAY in sendsignals
   * mountfs does not mount network filesystems [identified by _netdev
     in /etc/fstab]
   * removed unneded touch out of cleanfs

n/a - January 30, 2004:

   * New maintainers for the lfs-bootscripts package are:
     Jeremy Utley (jeremy@linuxfromscratch.org)
     Nathan Coulson (nathan@linuxfromscratch.org)

1.11 - February 3rd, 2003:

   * /etc/mtab is now a real file and is handled correctly so there are
   no errors even when the machine has crashed.

1.10 - September 12th, 2002:

   * Fixed up checkfs to work with non-ext2 filesystems too (such as
     minix).

1.9 - April 5th, 2002:

   * reloadproc function had a missing '=' in the "failure 1" command (it
     should be failure=1)

   * When script exists with unexpected value, you have to hit "Enter" to
     continue, not just a random key as printed on the screen.

   * Moved K10sysklogd, K20sendsignals, K30mount and K40swap to
     K40sysklogd, K50sendsignals, K60mount, K70swap

   * Changed the #!/bin/sh lines to #!/bin/bash - /bin/sh may not be
     linked to bash but to some other shell of your choice. These scripts
     are written to work with bash, so you can't just run them when
     /bin/sh -> csh or ash or whatever else tickles your fancy. This
     change should fix that.

1.8 - March 14th, 2002:

   * Fixed the getpids function call so PPID's would be taken into account
     properly.

   * Added the 'contrib' directory with other people's bootscript
     implementations.

1.7 - March 10th, 2002:

   * Used code from Matthias Benkmann's simpleinit-msb @
     http://winterdrache.de/linux/newboot/index.html mainly for improved
     killproc function handling

   * When a requested process isn't running, or is already running, a
     warning "Not running" or "Already running" will be displayed. This
     was out of allignment due to a missing $CURS_UP

   * Removed "||exit" from ifup and ifdown scripts. They are useless.

   * Changed the loadkeys script to run "loadkeys -d" and removed the need
     for the /etc/sysconfig/keyboard file. The kbd patch fixes the
     "loadkeys -d" behaviour.

1.6 - February 26th, 2002:

   * replaced -o %PPID with -o $PPID throughout the functions script. This
     construct does what it's supposed to do (don't take PPID into account
     because this would fail if a running daemon and the bootscript have
     the same name).

   * added 'restart' to the swap script

   * instead of using 'echo -n' to suppress newlines so the [ OK ] and
     related messages align properly, substitute this with a single echo
     command that simply goes one line up before outputting anything. This
     also has the benefit that when programs have their own output (like
     swapon, fsck and loadkeys), there won't be an unwanted blank line
     between the program's output and the [ OK ] et all. messages.

1.5 - February 2nd, 2002:

   * added 'exit 1' to the statusproc function when there aren't enough
   parameters passed to it (such as the name of process to check for)

1.4 - February 2nd, 2002:

   * when /fastboot is detected and the message about it is printed,
     don't run 'exit 1' else the rc script will cause a [FAILED] to
     be printed which is undesired in this case.

1.3 - January 30th, 2002:
   * network script: changed default route detection by using the same
     method as used when starting the script: check if the GATEWAY
     variable is set

   * removed the emptying of /etc/mtab since it's a symlink to
     /proc/mounts now

   * added the mountproc script which mounts the proc system. This is done
     because we need proc mounted even before the mountfs script is ran
     (now that /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts)

   * removed all absolute paths from command calls

   * added umask 022 and PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin" to the
     functions script. Every file now sources this so that umask and PATH
     are set correctly

1.2 - January 26th, 2002:
   * network script: detect if a default route is set before removing it
