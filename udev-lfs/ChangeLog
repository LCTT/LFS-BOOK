   * Makefile.lfs: Remove build procedures leaving only LFS rules

2014-02-16  <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
   * Makefile.lfs: Adjust warning flags.  Adjust linking rules to
     allow build with util-linux in LFS's /tools directory.

2010-01-26	Matt Burgess <matthew@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove lots of rules that have been merged upstream.
	* 61-cdrom.rules: Remove as upstream has a replacement.
	* doc/*: Cleanup and rewrite now that the rules are much simpler.

2009-09-25	Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Make the RTC rule (which runs setclock) work for people
	  that don't use the RTC-class driver -- add another copy of the rule,
	  using KERNEL=="rtc" instead of SUBSYSTEM=="rtc".  Also move the ACTION
	  match before the assignment to MODE.

2009-05-23	Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Set the rtc by udev upon boot.  Removed aio device from
	  udev configuration so defaults are used.

2009-05-16	Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Adopt udev permissions for random, urandom, kmsg, and
	  input devices (including psaux, which probably doesn't exist anymore
	  anyway).

2009-05-16	Matt Burgess <matthew@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove the block rule as it was only setting
	  permissions that Udev will set by default
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove the rfcomm rule as the group it sets is already
	  included in upstream's rule
	* 55-lfs-rules: Remove the tape rules as the group they sets is already
	  included in upstream's rules

2009-03-15	Bryan Kadzban <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove the ISDN-handling rules (replaced with upstream's
	  version, which has a better match via SUBSYSTEM).
	* 55-lfs.rules: Replace "uucp" with "dialout" now that udev has decided
	  to standardize on a Debian-like setup (uucp is for UUCP daemons to use
	  for privilege separation; dialout is for users and devices).

2008-12-07  Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Change one line to use continuation so it does
	  not overflow the book's width.

2008-12-07  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove several rules that are either provided by upstream,
	  or that don't have any effect (there is no /dev/js or /dev/djs according
	  to devices.txt).
	* 55-lfs.rules, 61-cdrom.rules: Replace ACTION=="add" with "add|change"
	  everywhere, per upstream's general request.

2008-11-11  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules, 61-cdrom.rules: Fix comments to use the right rule
	  numbers.  Thanks to Trent Shea for the fix.  Closes #2278.

2008-10-15  DJ Lucas <dj@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Override default perms on floppy disk devices provided
	  by 50-udev-default.rules.  Thanks to Bruce Dubbs for the fix.  Closes
	  LFS ticket #2076. 

2008-05-21  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 81-firmware.rules, doc/81-firmware.txt: Remove.  This rule is
	  already handled by udev's 50-udev-default.rules file.  The docs
	  can be added back later if needed.
	* Makefile: Don't install the above deleted files.
	* 55-lfs.rules: Remove the device-mapper rule, since the upstream
	  50-udev-default.rules file handles it properly.

2008-04-02  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Makefile: Make the package DESTDIR-friendly by installing the docs
	  into a fixed $(PREFIX)/share/doc/udev-config directory, instead of
	  trying to figure out what version of udev was just installed.

2007-10-30  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 55-lfs.rules: Since the dialout group was renamed to uucp, delete
	  the rules that override upstream's assignment of the dialout group.
	  Replace "dialout" with "uucp" on the remaining rules.

2007-10-29  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 51-lfs.rules: Move to 55-lfs.rules.
	* doc/51-lfs.rules: Move to doc/55-lfs.rules.

2007-10-27  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Some rules in here are duplicates of rules from udev's
	  new 50-udev-defaults.rules file; remove them. Override permissions
	  where needed elsewhere (and document overrides in comments).
	* 26-modprobe.rules: Provided by udev's 80-drivers.rules and built-in
	  modaliases for SCSI device-type modules in 2.6.22+ kernels; remove.

	* 25-lfs.rules: Move to 51-lfs.rules.
	* 27-firmware.rules: Move to 81-firmware.rules.
	* 81-cdrom.rules: Move to 61-cdrom.rules.

	* doc/25-lfs.txt: Rename to 51-lfs.txt.
	* doc/26-modprobe.txt: Rename to 80-drivers.txt, and modify to reflect
	  the upstream rules.
	* doc/27-firmware.txt: Rename to 81-firmware.txt.
	* doc/81-cdrom.txt: Rename to 61-cdrom.txt.

	* Makefile: Use new filenames.

2007-07-31  Dan Nicholson <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Changed the usb_device rule tto create /dev/bus/usb
	  nodes if the usb_device in 2.6.22+ kernels. The rule was also changed
	  to only trigger on "add" events. This change is not backwards
	  compatible with older kernels.

2007-06-12  Dan Nicholson <dnicholson@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Fix the CPUID nodes from cpu/%n/cpu to cpu/%n/cpuid,
	  which is what's expected in userspace apps such as x86info.

2007-06-08  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Add rules for DVB devices (create nodes in /dev/dvb/)
	  and floppies (create extra nodes based on CMOS type), copied from
	  the SuSE rules file.  Thanks to Alexander Patrakov for the bugreport.

2007-03-04  Matthew Burgess	<matthew@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Makefile: Use `udevd --version' to work out what version of Udev is
	  installed (requires Udev >= 106)

2007-01-02  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Change CPU devices (cpu, msr, microcode) to be in
	  /dev/cpu/ and /dev/cpu/N/, to match Documentation/devices.txt.

2006-10-21  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Makefile: Add a missing backslash in install-extra-doc.

	* 05-udev-early.rules, 60-persistent-input.rules,
	  60-persistent-storage.rules, 95-udev-late.rules: Remove.  The book
	  will install these files from udev's etc/udev/rules.d directory
	  instead.
	* Makefile: Don't install these rules files after all.  Also, only
	  install corresponding docs if requested.

2006-10-20  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Makefile: Added; contains targets to install rules and doc files.
	  From Dan Nicholson.

2006-10-14  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 05-udev-early.rules, 60-persistent-storage.rules: Sync up with
	  upstream sample rules files (from udev-102), except for one rule
	  which is more specific in our tarball and should probably be changed
	  upstream. 
	* doc/60-persistent-storage.txt: Modify to match the changes.  Also
	  fix a couple typos.

	* 25-lfs.rules: Remove duplicate rules (ttyS[0-9]* is also matched by
	  tty[BC...S...][0-9]*, and ttyUSB[0-9]* is in there twice).

	* 25-lfs.rules: Fix Alsa device KERNEL rules.  Udev uses shell-style
	  glob matching, not regular expressions, so the old rules would match
	  nonsense device names like hw0asdf and pcmDzxcv.  As long as the first
	  character after the "fixed" portion was in the list, the rule would
	  match; it wouldn't apply the same character range to later characters.

	* doc/25-lfs.txt: Add a note on interaction between permissions and
	  symlinks.

2006-10-09  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscrtach.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Fix fb[0-9]* device permissions (should use the default
	  0660).

	* doc/25-lfs.txt: Fix typo: /dev/ptmx is given mode 0666, not 0660.
	  Also tweak the comment about other TTY devices.

2006-10-04  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 05-udev-early.rules: Remove WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="bus" rule.  With kernel
	  2.6.18, this rule is no longer required.

	* doc/05-udev-early.txt: Update to match.

2006-09-28  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* doc/60-persistent-storage.txt: Explain persistent storage rules, or
	  at least the parts I understand.  (I don't use DASD or netblock or
	  several other supported configurations.)

	* doc/81-cdrom.txt: Explain 81-cdrom.rules.

	* doc/95-udev-late.txt: Explain 95-udev-late.rules.  Documentation is
	  now finished.

2006-09-26  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* doc/60-persistent-input.txt: Explain (in probably too much detail)
	  60-persistent-input.rules.

2006-09-24  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* doc/05-udev-early.txt: Rewrap to fit 80 columns.

	* doc/26-modprobe.txt: Explain 26-modprobe.rules, and modaliases.

	* doc/27-firmware.txt: Explain 27-firmware.rules.

2006-09-24  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* doc/25-lfs.txt: Explain 25-lfs.rules.

	* 25-lfs.rules: Use SYMLINK+= for isdn/capi20 also.

2006-09-23  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* doc: New subdirectory to contain documentation of rules
	* doc/README: New file, top-level documentation
	* doc/*.txt: New documentation files, one for each rules file.  Only
	  05-udev-early.txt has anything in it.

2006-09-23  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 25-lfs.rules: Add "ignore_device" to OPTIONS for DRI devices, instead
	  of setting NAME to an empty string.  This matches the way we ignore
	  devmapper / LVM devices.

2006-09-22  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 60-persistent-input.rules, 95-udev-late.rules: Import from udev-100.
	  60-persistent-input.rules creates persistent symlinks for input
	  devices, and 95-udev-late.rules enables udevmonitor.

	* 60-persistent-storage.rules: Replace ATTRS{../removable} with just
	  ATTRS{removable} on partition devices. Replace ATTRS{removable}
	  with ATTR{removable} on whole-disk devices.

2006-09-20  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 05-early.rules: Missed a rule in the last change.  ENV{PHYSDEVBUS}
	  in the rule that waits for the "bus" symlink should be replaced by
	  SUBSYSTEMS.

2006-09-20  Bryan Kadzban  <bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Adapted rules to the new matches used in udev-098 and above (e.g.,
	  SYSFS becomes ATTRS).  Prevents warnings, and support for the old
	  matches will be removed eventually.  These rules will not work with
	  udev-097 and before!
	* Fixed several bugs in the rules left over from previous udev
	  versions (missing commas, overwriting user symlinks using ="..."
	  instead of +="...", and matching against "*" instead of "?*").

	* Renamed CHANGELOG to ChangeLog, started using pseudo-GNU-format
	  entries.  (See standards.info; search it for "changelog" to get
	  the general gist.)

dnicholson - Jul 14, 2006
