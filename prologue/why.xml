  <title>Rationale for Packages in the Book</title>

    <para>As stated earlier, the goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable
    foundation-level system.  This includes all packages needed to replicate
    itself while providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize
    a more complete system based on the choices of the user.  This does not
    mean that LFS is the smallest system possible.  Several important packages
    are included that are not strictly required.  The lists below document the
    rationale for each package in the book.</para>
