  <title>Cleaning Up</title>

  <para>Finally, clean up some extra files left around from running tests:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /tmp/*</userinput></screen>

  <para>From now on, when reentering the chroot environment after
  exiting, use the following modified chroot command:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i              \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin     \
    /bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

  <para>The reason for this is that the programs in <filename
  class="directory">/tools</filename> are no longer needed.  Since they are no
  longer needed you can delete the <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>
  directory if so desired.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> will also
    remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect, and DejaGNU which were used
    for running the toolchain tests. If you need these programs later on,
    they will need to be recompiled and re-installed. The BLFS book has
    instructions for this (see <ulink url="&blfs-root;"/>).</para>
  </note>

  <para>If the virtual kernel file systems have been unmounted, either manually
  or through a reboot, ensure that the virtual kernel file systems are mounted
  when reentering the chroot. This process was explained in <xref
  linkend="ch-system-bindmount"/> and <xref
  linkend="ch-system-kernfsmount"/>.</para>

  <para>Finally, there were several static libraries that were not suppressed earlier
  in the chapter in order to satisfy the regression tests in several packages. These 
  libraries are from binutils, bzip2, e2fsprogs, flex, libtool, and zlib.  If desired,
  remove them now:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -f /usr/lib/lib{bfd,opcodes}.a
rm -f /usr/lib/libbz2.a
rm -f /usr/lib/lib{com_err,e2p,ext2fs,ss}.a
rm -f /usr/lib/libltdl.a
rm -f /usr/lib/libfl.a
rm -f /usr/lib/libfl_pic.a
rm -f /usr/lib/libz.a</userinput></screen>
